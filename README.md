Basic blog where each post is wrapped by the div tag "post". Naturally, this is not a realistic way of building a blog. To get it to work as a blog you would need to automate the post-admition page, comments, upvotes, etc. 

## Goals

* Implement bootstrap 
* Clean up the design
* Create a form like system so blog posts can be added with ease, and without doing it in HTML.
